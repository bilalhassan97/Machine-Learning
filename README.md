This repository contains the practise exercises i have done during my first two weeks at Metis Pvt. International Islamabad.
It contains separate folders for mutiple exercises which i have done to get myself fimiliar with analysis manipulation operations performed on data using panda and numpy libary. 
I have further worked on seaborn library which helped me perform multiple types of visualisations on data.
